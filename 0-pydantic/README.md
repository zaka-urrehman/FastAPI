# Pydantic

Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python. It provides a way to define data schemas using Python data types and annotations, and it automatically validates and parses input data according to these schemas. Pydantic is particularly useful for working with data that comes from external sources, such as user inputs, API requests, or configuration files. Pydantic's core validation logic is written in Rust. As a result, Pydantic is among the fastest data validation libraries for Python.
